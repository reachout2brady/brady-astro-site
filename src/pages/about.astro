  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>Hi, I’m Brady — a CRM automation consultant based in St. Petersburg, Florida.</p>

  <p>I help small business owners unlock growth by making their tools work smarter. My background in furniture retail and sales taught me firsthand how leads get lost, how follow-ups break down, and how a good system can turn chaos into clarity.</p>

  <p>Now, I build solutions. I take the CRM you already have — whether it’s HubSpot, Perq, Zoho, or a spreadsheet — and turn it into a revenue machine. No fluff. Just practical workflows, smart integrations, and systems that make your team faster and your customers happier.</p>

  <p>If you’re tired of missed leads, repetitive tasks, or disconnected tools, let’s talk. I’ll meet you where you are and help you build something that actually works.</p>
