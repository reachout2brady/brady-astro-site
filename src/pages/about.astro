        Hi, I’m Brady — a CRM automation consultant based in St. Petersburg, Florida.
      </p>

      <p>
        I help small business owners unlock growth by making their tools work smarter. My background in
        furniture retail and sales taught me firsthand how leads get lost, how follow-ups break down, and
        how a good system can turn chaos into clarity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, I build solutions. I take the CRM you already have — whether it’s HubSpot, Perq, Zoho, or a
        spreadsheet — and turn it into a revenue machine. No fluff. Just practical workflows, smart
        integrations, and systems that make your team faster and your customers happier.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re tired of missed leads, repetitive tasks, or disconnected tools, let’s talk. I’ll meet you
        where you are and help you build something that actually works.
      </p>
