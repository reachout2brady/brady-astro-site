  <p>This is a growing collection of tools, automations, and systems I’ve built to help businesses operate more efficiently and connect with their customers more effectively.</p>

    <h2>🛋️ Brady’s Virtual Showroom</h2>
    <p>A full interactive showroom for Kane’s Furniture built using Softr, Dropbox AR model hosting, and CRM-integrated contact tracking. Customers can preview furniture in their space, explore collections, and submit interest — all from one streamlined hub.</p>

    <h2>🏷️ Online Prospecting Workflow</h2>
    <p>Custom Python Selenium script that automates my online prospecting within the Perq CRM platform. The script identifies new leads, applies a conquest tag, removes them from active filters, and initiates outbound messaging — streamlining repetitive CRM tasks and improving lead conversion speed.</p>
    <p>This system effectively eliminates manual steps in my day-to-day sales process, allowing me to spend more time closing and less time clicking.</p>

    <h2>🔗 Zapier Lead Integration</h2>
