    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
      As a current furniture salesperson and amatuer builder, here is a growing collection of tools, automations, and systems I’ve built to help businesses operate more efficiently and connect with their customers more effectively.

    <div class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">📟 Brady’s Virtual Showroom</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        A full interactive showroom for Kane’s Furniture built using Softr, Dropbox AR model hosting, and CRM-integrated contact tracking. Customers can preview furniture in their space, explore collections, and submit interest — all from one streamlined hub.

    <div class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">🧠 Online Prospecting Workflow</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Custom Python Selenium script that automates my online prospecting within the Perq CRM platform. The script identifies new leads, applies a conquest tag, removes them from active filters, and initiates outbound messaging — streamlining repetitive CRM tasks and improving lead conversion speed.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        This system effectively eliminates manual steps in my day-to-day sales process, allowing me to spend more time closing and less time clicking.

    <div class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">🔗 Zapier Lead Integration</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Created a Zapier flow to auto-capture leads from web forms, filter by service type, and route them into segmented Google Sheets with automated email notifications.
      </p>
    </div>
<div class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">🔗 Department Tracker</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
Created a Google Sheet that automates, stores customers preferred choices, and tracks how often a salesperson is mentioning certain departments and offering financing options for customers.      </p>
